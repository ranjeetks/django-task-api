8.Deploy to Cloud (Render / Railway)

 Prepare project for deployment (whitenoise, allowed hosts, etc.).

 Deploy to Render or Railway and test live endpoints.

 Set up GitHub repository for version control.

 Add CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (automated testing, deployment).

9.README.md Documentation

 Write clear project overview, features, and setup instructions.

 Add API endpoint details (methods, paths, request/response).

 Include screenshots or links to Swagger UI / live app.

10.Simple UI to Consume API

 Build a basic frontend (React.js or another trending framework).

 Connect UI to backend (login, task list, create/update/delete tasks).

 Optional: Host frontend on Netlify/Vercel and link in README.

11.Optional Enhancements
